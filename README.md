# Trello Clone

A modern project management application built with SvelteKit that replicates core Trello functionality for team collaboration and task management.

## Introduction

This Trello Clone is a comprehensive project management platform designed to help teams organize, track, and manage their work efficiently. Built with modern web technologies, it provides a familiar Kanban-style interface for managing tasks across different project boards.

The application features a multi-tenant architecture with organization support, allowing teams to collaborate on projects while maintaining data isolation. Users can create boards, organize tasks in columns, assign work to team members, set priorities and due dates, and track project progress in real-time.

Key highlights include drag-and-drop task management, real-time collaboration, user authentication with social login support, comprehensive filtering and search capabilities, and a responsive design that works across all devices.
